# TheWeekndMockSite
This small but fun project is being done to reintroduce me to web development. 
In this project, I create a mock website for TheWeeknd. It consists of an About page, 
a Store page as well as a general Home page. This project is divided into three stages, 
the first stage is developing the HTML files, the second stage is working on the CSS 
for all three pages, and the third stage is implementing Javascript to add light 
interaction with the website.
